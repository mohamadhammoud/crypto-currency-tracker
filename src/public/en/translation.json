     "Crypto History." : "The story of these virtual coins begins with one person: the cryptographer David Chaum. In 1983, the American developed a cryptographic system called eCash. Twelve years later, he developed another system, DigiCash, that used cryptography to make economic transactions confidential. However, the first time the idea or term 'cryptocurrency' was coined was in 1998. That year, Wei Dai began to think about developing a new payment method that used a cryptographic system and whose main characteristic was decentralization."
